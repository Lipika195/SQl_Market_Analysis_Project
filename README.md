Project Title: 
Smartphone Market Analysis using SQL & Excel

Project Overview
 This project presents a detailed analysis of smartphone market trends using structured SQL queries and Excel-based visualizations. By querying a dataset of smartphone specifications and features, it explores      brand performance, pricing trends, 5G support, hardware configurations, and user ratings.
 The insights have been visually represented through Excel charts and compiled into a PDF report for easy interpretation and presentation.
 The aim is to generate valuable insights for data-driven decision-making by answering real-world business questions such as:
- Which brands offer the most smartphones?
- How do pricing and features vary across brands?
- What is the level of 5G penetration in the market?
- Which smartphones provide the best value?

The dataset contains the following fields:

- brand_name – Name of the smartphone brand
- model – Model of the smartphone
- price – Price in INR
- rating – User rating score
- has_5G, has_NFC, has_IR_blaster – Feature availability
- ram_capacity, internal_memory – RAM and Storage in GB
- battery_capacity – Battery size (mAh)
- processor_brand, processor_speed, os – Technical specs

Objectives:

- Explore market share by brand
- Analyze pricing and feature segmentation
- Identify top-rated and value-for-money smartphones
- Understand consumer trends in 5G adoption
- Visualize data using Excel for easy interpretation
